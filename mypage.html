      <p>Cockatiels are small parrots that are native to Australia. Known for their gentler, quieter nature, they are often very popular type of pet parrot. Many people know of cockatiels as the parrots with “mohawks”. These head feathers are actually called a crest, and can let you know of that cockatiel’s mood. Cockatiels can be easy to train and their social nature gives people the opportunity to pet, talk to, and interact with them. </p>

      <h2>Bird Care</h2>
      <p>Before I got a parrot, I did hours upon hours of research. The level of care involved in having a pet bird is often underestimated. Especially with larger birds, there is more care involved than with them than even dogs! They require a lot of attention, and the finances of owning a bird are often overlooked as well. Avian vet charges are much more expensive than vet expenses for cats or dogs. A helpful website I looked at first was Mickaboo.org, but I highly recommend people interested in getting a bird to do a lot of research and consider taking a Mickaboo bird class!</p>

      <h2>About Athena</h2>
      <p>Athena was somebody’s lost bird that we indirectly adopted. When we didn’t hear back from any owner claiming her, she became our bird. Because of her regal, “don’t touch me” aura, I named her as such. She’s afraid of hands, hates most humans, but loves my dad. She could sit with him for hours. She is a beautiful pearl cockatiel.</p>

      <h2>About Pepper</h2>
      <p>Pepper is a three year old male cockatiel who loves to whistle, scream, and give kisses. Unlike Athena, he enjoys my company and loves to listen to any tunes I whistle to him. He was named Pepper because the dark color of his wings resembled black pepper. Both birds are very picky eaters and love baths when it's hot.</p>
